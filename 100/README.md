# 100 - Introduction

Banktivity(macOS app) does it (i.e. download bank statements) with 'direct download' (one time fee to buy the app), and stores it in a sqlite3 DB file. Getting it out of sqlite is trivial.

If your bank(s) are not covered by direct download, then you can pay a yearly fee to Banktivity and they will download through paid service. No, it's not Open Source Software (OSS), but my bank(s) are covered by direct download, so it's easy and no cost to me anymore.

That's how I do it, but I got banktivity as part of some package deal, so I tried it out. It's a fine app in it's own right, for managing finances, but I like having a vcs repo of all of my transaction information as well :)

Dear reader, I am a happy user of Banktivity (a financial admin app on OSX) that uses the Yodlee service (yodlee.com) as the provider for direct access and download of transaction information. In the Netherlands several banks (ING, ABNAMRO etc) are connected.

Adding the link to Banktivity. https://www.iggsoftware.com/banktivity/
Direct Access: This powerful, optional subscription service automatically updates accounts from over 10,000 banks and financial institutions worldwide - all for as little as 11 cents a day. Update all your devices with one subscription.
What Banktivity calls "Direct Access", in the background is Yodlee. Works like a charm for me.
