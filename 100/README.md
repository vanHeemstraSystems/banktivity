# 100 - Introduction

Banktivity(macOS app) does it (i.e. download bank statements) with 'direct download' (one time fee to buy the app), and stores it in a sqlite3 DB file. Getting it out of sqlite is trivial.

If your bank(s) are not covered by direct download, then you can pay a yearly fee to Banktivity and they will download through plaid service. No, it's not OSS, but my bank(s) are covered by direct download, so it's easy and no cost to me anymore.

That's how I do it, but I got banktivity as part of some package deal, so I tried it out. It's a fine app in it's own right, for managing finances, but I like having a vcs repo of all of my transaction information as well :)
